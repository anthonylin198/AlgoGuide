// Min heaps and max heaps. Min heap every node will be less than its children. --- think of a tree but into an array
// Heaps must be completely filled except for last level, which must be filled from left to right

// Say Heap is not standard data in Javascript - but can use a function to just heapify the array

// Heaps can be represented as arrays,
//     currentNode = i           childNode1 = 2i + 1     childNode2 -> 2i + 2

// parentNode -> Math.floor((i - 1)/2)
