// todo Permutations and Subsets
/*
1) Use the depth first search approach, always taking the elements before and adding
2) With All combinations start with beginning and make slices
3) With the permutations we need to insert at every index, we need to shift. Triple nested for loop - the regular arr, then the array itself, then adding at every index

// todo Graphs (store v vertices/nodes, and e edges) O(V+E) space and O(V+E) time
/*

1) Connected, cyclical/acyclical, and directional are the key concepts
2) Every graph node has the value, along with list of adjacent nodes
3) Understand depth first search and breadth first search
