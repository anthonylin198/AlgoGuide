// todo: Permutations and Subsets
/*
1) Use the depth first search approach, always taking the elements before and adding
2) With All combinations start with beginning and make slices
3) With the permutations we need to insert at every index, we need to shift. Triple nested for loop - the regular arr, then the array itself, then adding at every index

// todo: Matrix Rotations
/*
1) Typically with matrix problems look from differe perspective -- as arrays then as the actualy grids
2) Use 2 pointer approach to reverse, nad think of how you would manipulate i and j to fix ceratin aspects
*/

// todo: String Problems
/*
1) Checking palindrome along the way --- start from beginning and use the left and right pointer. Think edge case when there is a "bb"
2) String problems use an array. Remember you can assign [] and empty spaces    [a, empty, a, empty, a, empty, a, empty]
3) When you slice, 0,0 will not include anything

// todo: Linked Lists
/*
1) be able to combine multiple concepts such as addtwo numbers -- Slow down and always remember to iterate every pointer, and check if they exist or not
2) When in doubt, create references to keep track of later -- create the new ll

1) Know all bst order - preorder, postorder, level-order
Inorder: 4 2 5 1 3       left, root, right
Preorder: 1 2 4 5 3      Root, left, right
Postorder: 4 5 2 3 1

2) Understand how to build from scratch --> somewhat similar to the divide and conquer. But do recursively. Extract information and keep

1) Make sure to check the conditionals, make recursive calls
2) change positions to null rather than trying to keep a cache
3) instead of ij, start changing that to row column

1) Connected, cyclical/acyclical, and directional are the key concepts
2) Every graph node has the value, along with list of adjacent nodes
3) Understand depth first search and breadth first search

2) For a rotated array, if you split in half, we know both the sides are still sorted
