/*

You are given an integer array nums sorted in ascending order, and an integer target.

Suppose that nums is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand (i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7]
   might become [4,5,0,1,2]).

   We are looking for 4

If target is found in the array return its index, otherwise, return -1.

*/

/*

If divided in half, we know that one side of the array is sorted
