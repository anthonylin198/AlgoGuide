// todo: String - Be comfortable with replace and match from regex as well as String.charCodeAt, String.fromCharCode, and substr

/*

String.charCodeAt
 
    if (((code >= 48) && (code <= 57))  // numbers
    || ((code >= 65) && (code <= 90))  // uppercase
    || ((code >= 97) && (code <= 122))) {  // lowercase

    LOWERCASE TO UPPERCASE, WE NEED TO ADD 32



REGEX METHODS
      replace(/[^a-z0-9]/g, "") -- this will only keep letters and numbers
      matches(/[a-z][0-9]/g)     -- turns into array of characters and matches



SLICE AND SUBSTRING essentially do the same. Can just add together

  arr.slice(0, i) + arr.slice(i+1) this would get rid of the middle character each time

*/

// todo: Sorting
/*
SORT METHOD: return -1 for in order an 1 for not in order


MANUAL: Be able to use 2 pointers and manually sort as you need. Learn some of 
the other sorting algorithms later as well

*/

// todo: Binary Search - Divide and Conquer
/*

Remember to not double check values. KEEP TRACK OF start and the end, and you want to
continusly check the middle. Check first bad version to get a sense of this


*/

// todo: Carry Over : Adding strings or binary
/*
Remember the carry needs to be part of the conditional in cases like 9 + 1 = 10

*/

// todo: Simple Recursion
/*

*/

// todo: Creating classes - Taking the average sum
/*
Remember to not name things in the constructor the same as the names of the methods
that you are going to create

*/

// todo: LinkedList - Be able to iterate through linkedlist, keep track of pointers -- reverse and merge linkedlists

// todo: Binary Trees - Be able to iterate through DFS and BFS. Understand saving variables and recursion then returning.
