/*

Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new sorted list. New list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists

Input: l1 = [1,2,4], l2 = [1,3,4]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]

Input: l1 = [], l2 = []
Output: []


Input: l1 = [], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]

/*

sort two sorted linked lists in order by splicing the nodes

Input: l1 = [1,2,4], l2 = [1,3,4]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]

todo: Solution 1: We will create 2 pointers, and merge l2 into l1. One pointer at l1.head and 1 value at l2.head.
if l2.value > l1.value, iterate through l1 and compare
