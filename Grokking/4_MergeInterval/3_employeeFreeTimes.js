// Prompt: for 'K' employees, we are intervals representing working hours for each employee. Find free interval common for all employees. Assume sorted by start time

// input = [[1,3], [9,12],[[2,4], [6,8]]]

// ! One solution: Put the working hours of all employees in a list, and sort them on start time. Then we can iterate through the list to find gaps




// ! Second solution is using a minheap - can read up more on this later
